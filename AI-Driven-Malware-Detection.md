**INTRODUCTION**

Generally, malware is one of the most pervasive and damaging forms of attack in the rapidly
evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. It is capable of compromising systems, which can
lead to stealing of sensitive data and disrupting important infrastructures. In recent times, there has

been a common shift from traditional signature-based and heuristic methods of malware detection
to a more sophisticated and diverse modern malware variant. Thus, it has become increasingly
challenging and that has led to the widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven malware
detection and classification. This AI-driven approaches are common with the use of machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), which offer the potential of threat identification, attack
vector adaptation, and high-speed accurate processing of large volumes of data that may not be
possible with traditional signature-based and heuristic methods of malware detection.

Aslan and Samet (2020) referred to malware detection as the act of figuring out whether or not a
particular application has malicious intent. The authors noted that malware was first detected using
a signature-based detection technique, which has shortcomings including inability to identify
malware that is unknown or of a fresh generation. They highlighted that there are different
approaches that have been proposed including behavioral-, heuristic-, and model checking-based
detection. Aside these approaches, others have also been proposed including deep learning-, cloud, mobile devices-, and IoT-based detection. Aboaoja et al. (2022) noted that behavioral-based
approach can be evaded by malware that can discriminate between analytic environment and the
actual machine environment. It was noted further that malware detection and classification models
using automated or manual criteria increase the accuracy of malware detection.

McLaughlin et al. (2017) mentioned that malware detection techniques can be divided into three
categories, which include signature based, heuristic based, and specification based. These
techniques can either be traditional or AI-driven. In contrast to traditional techniques, machine
learning-based detection can identify malware that have not yet been discovered and can offer
superior efficacy and efficiency (Liu et al., 2020). Ye et al. (2017) averred that the development of
intelligent techniques for successful and efficient malware detection from the actual and extensive
daily sample collection is required to manage or reduce the rise in malware samples. As malware
detection techniques advance, malware detectors employ a variety of strategies to prevent the
catastrophic impacts of these programs. Malware detectors are used to identify these malwares,
and antivirus scanners are one method to identify some of them (Tahir, 2018).

Android OS has dominated the worldwide smart phone, which has some malicious software that
can exploit data and privacy on Android devices (Hsieh et al., 2015). Damodaran et al. (2017)
noted that that Android malware detection technology can be categorized into static detection,
dynamic detection, and hybrid detection. These categories are the analysis approaches that may be
employed in malware detection. According to Anderson et al. (2017), static malware detection has
been in use since at least 2001 and is a crucial component of a security system as, when done
correctly, it may identify malicious files before they are executed. For example, when an existing
file undergoes modification when it is written to disk, or when it is asked to execute. Liu et al.
(2020) noted that dynamic detection entails the analysis of applications by running the code.
Although dynamic detection requires a comparatively large amount of time and processing

resources, it can reveal risks that are difficult to identify with static analysis. In order to identify
behavior or malicious functionality in programs, hybrid approaches include run-time data from
dynamic analysis into a static analysis technique (Rao & Hande, 2017).

Abusitta et al. (2021) observed that deep learning models are applied to improve malware
classification accuracy in both detection and classification. In addition to classifying malware, it
was further observed that malware analysis experts have developed new methodologies and
strategies to assess the composition of malware samples by comparing their behavior and features
to several known malware families. Aslan and Yilmaz (2021) described malware classification as
a step further to malware detection. The authors noted that malware classification is the
determination of the category or family of malware after a file has been identified as malware.
Cakir and Dogdu (2018) noted that there are two stages of malware analysis. The first phase is the
malware detection phase, which concerns the initial detection and identification of malware.
Malware classification phase concerns the security systems attempt to identify or categorize every
threat sample as belonging to one of the relevant malware families during the second phase. In
malware classification, the feature vector selection techniques are employed, which may be
categorized into static and dynamic analysis (Islam et al., 2013).

Having established that the malware technology analysis for malware classification comprises of
static and dynamic analysis, there are no hybrid analysis approach compared to malware detection.
This provides that malware classification integrates run-time data from dynamic analysis into a
static analysis technique (Chanajitt et al., 2021). Meanwhile, malware classification can be carried
out using a wide variety of machine learning classifiers, which include logistic regression, neural
networks, and decision trees (Pascanu et al., 2015). When compared to traditional learning
algorithms, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a deep learning technique, have demonstrated
better performance, particularly in applications like image classification. Moreover, it was
established that Microsoft malware and Malimg malware outperform the state-of-the-art
performance on the difficult malware classification datasets (Kalash et al., 2018).

The continuous growth in technological development has led to a concerning increase in the
incidence and sophistication of malware attacks. For instance, the traditional malware detection
techniques, such as polymorphic and zero-day malware, are not capable of detecting the newly
developed malware (Deldar & Abadi, 2023). Therefore, there is a need for a more intelligent
solutions, which is an AI-enhanced malware detection and classification approaches. These AIenhanced approaches are engineered through machine learning and deep learning systems, which
offer a dynamic approach for enhancing malware detection and classification (Faiz et al., 2025).
Studies (e.g., Chandran et al., 2025; Moamin et al., 2025) have proposed different AI-based
methods, a comprehensive understanding of the techniques and effectiveness remains unknown.
Moreover, the datasets associated with some of the AI-driven models proposed and tested are
limited or outdated, which raises concerns about generalizability and real-world performance. This

performance may influence the effectiveness in the long-run. It is against the foregoing that this
study seeks to examine AI-driven malware detection and classification with a focus on the
techniques and effectiveness of those AI-models that have been proposed. The research questions
for this systematic review are:


1. What is the AI-driven techniques used in malware detection and classification?
2. What is the effectiveness of the AI-driven malware detection and classification

approaches?
3. What are the evaluation strategies for AI-based malware detection and classification

systems?
4. What are the challenges associated with the deployment of AI-driven malware detection

and classification systems?

**METHODOLOGY**

This study adopts the meta-synthesis research design, which is a type of research that involves
qualitative case studies of literature in a systematic approach to ascertain insights from available
evidence in the literature (Leary & Walker, 2018). This approach is different from meta-analysis
that does not provide comprehensive quality evidence on the data extracted from the literature.
This study seeks to use provide insights on AI-driven malware detection and classification with a
view of understanding the methods and effectiveness. The study is not limited to any geographical
scope, which means that literature published anywhere globally are in consideration for selection.
In a systematic literature review, process involves formulating research questions, searching
relevant databases for literature, screening of literature with set inclusion and exclusion criteria,
assessing the quality of the selected studies, extracting needed data from the studies using the
rubrics of data extraction table, and analyzing the collected data based on the research questions
(Lame, 2019).

This study conducted search on the literature by consulting different databases that may have
relevant articles on AI-driven malware detection and classification with it a focus on its technique
and effectiveness. Schut et al. (2024) recommended that credible and relevant databases should be
considered in carrying out a systematic review. The databases consulted for this study include
IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, and Web of Science (See Table 2).
These databases are considered to house relevant information material to answer the study’s
research question with the general aim of understanding AI-driven malware detection and
classification. Series of relevant literature were search and retrieved after which some set inclusion
and exclusion criteria were used to delimit the downloaded literature/articles. These criteria are
presented in Table 1.

Meanwhile, the Preferred Reporting for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
framework (see Figure 1) was used for structured data collection. This is believed to be the most
popular and trustworthy framework for systematic reviews (Helach et al., 2023). Thus, it was
considered for this study as the structured collection technique enhances objectivity, credibility,
and repeatability. The 27-item PRISMA is divided into four categories, which include
identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion. The identification stage focuses on the literature
search, which includes the sources and databases consulted for this study. These databases can be
viewed in Table 2. The screening stage concerns the consideration of the title and abstracts of the
retrieved literature from the consulted databases. The eligibility stage concerns the process of
implementing the inclusion and exclusion criteria that have been outlined to consider the final
selected literature. Having duly followed this process, the final selected literature for this study is
thirteen (15).

**RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**

As indicated in the PRISMA chart, the systematic review analyzed fifteen (15) studies, which
focused on AI-driven malware detection and classification technique with specific focus on the
techniques and classification. The selected studies span different sectors, which include healthcare,
technology, retail, manufacturing, finance/business, transportation, and security ventures. This
indicates that there is broad applicability of AI-enhanced malware defense systems. Moreover, the
studies adopted different methodological approaches, which include datasets and experimental
design. This offers diverse perspectives in understanding AI-enhanced malware detection and
classification with a focus on its technique and effectiveness. The varying methodological
approaches of the study suggests that the findings that emanate from this systematic review are
deepened in varieties of ways to understand the phenomenon under study.

On the research question one, the results showed that the techniques used in AI-driven malware
detection and classification include deep learning techniques, machine learning techniques, and
hybrid models and emerging technologies. Deep learning techniques identified include generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and autoencoders to improve predictive capabilities in malware
detection systems (Almotiri, 2025), recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short-term memory
(LSTM) for network-based and memory-based malware detection (Bavadiya et al., 2025; Dash,
2024; Gopalsamy, 2023), convolutional neutral networks (CNN) for the extraction of complex
spatial features malware samples (Dash, 2024; Manikandan et al., 2025; Mohammed et al., 2025),
and graph neural networks (GNN) (Dash, 2024). The analytical methods and algorithm used for
machine learning techniques include decision trees and random forests used for malware
classification (Manikandan et al., 2025), extreme gradient and LightGBM used for malware
detection in healthcare systems (Almotiri, 2025; Prabha et al., 2024), and naïve bayes (GNB) and
linear discriminant analysis (LDA) employed for social media malware detection (Gopalsamy,
2023). Hybrid AI models (Bavadiya et al., 2025; Mohammed et al., 2025), explainable AI (Alohali
et al., 2025; Prabha et al., 2024), and blockchain-integrated AI (Vekariya et al., 2025) are the hybrid
model approaches identified in the final selected studies.

On the research question two, the findings revealed that AI-driven systems have high effectiveness
in detecting and classifying malware, which indicates that relevance and usefulness. The results
showed that two of the studies (Almotiri, 2025; Manikandan et al., 2025) demonstrated accuracy
ranges of 97% to nearly 100% using Decision Trees and Random Forests. Moreover, it was shown
that there is advanced deep learning, showing that CNN-based methods demonstrated superior
performance in detecting complex malware patters (Dash, 2024; Mohammed et al., 2025).
Bavadiya et al. (2025) demonstrated that AUC achieved high scores of 0.91-0.94 with the
integration of autoencoders, random forests, and CNN-LSTM models. Moreover, two of the final
selected studies (Alohali et al., 2025; Gopalsamy, 2023) demonstrated that real-time threat

detection can be achieved through AI-driven systems with metrics such as recall, precision, and
F1-scores above 99%. Also, Phanireddy (2020) indicates that AI can detect obfuscated and
polymorphic malware through de-obfuscation and adaptive learning.

On the research question three, results showed that there are different evaluation metrics and
strategies in the final selected studies. The study demonstrated that there are standard metrics,
benchmark datasets, experimental comparisons, and cross-validation and preprocessing. The
studies showed that accuracy (Manikandan et al., 2025; Singh & Dubey, 2024); precision, recall,
and F1 score (Almotiri, 2025; Dash, 2024; Gopalsamy, 2023); and area under curve (Bavadiya et
al., 2025) are standard metrics for evaluating AI-driven malware detection and classification
systems. The benchmark datasets used for evaluation include CIC-IDS2017, Microsoft Malware
Dataset, EMBER, and BIG 2015 (Bavadiya et al., 2025; Gopalsamy, 2023; Polu, 2024). In terms
of experimental comparisons, the AI-driven systems are often compared with traditional methods
or the initial system to see the improvement with the introduction of the AI systems (Alohali et al.,
2025; Prabha et al., 2024). Results showed that the use of cross-validation and preprocessing,
feature selection, and class balancing techniques (Bavadiya et al., 2025; Singh & Dubey, 2024).

On the research question four, the challenges associated with the deployment of AI-driven malware
detection and classification systems include dataset limitations (Mohammed et al., 2025; Bavadiya
et al., 2025), computational complexity (Almotiri, 2025; Manikandan et al., 2025), interpretability
(Alohali et al., 2025; Prabha et al., 2024), adversarial attacks (Dash, 2024; Phanireddy, 2020), and
real-time deployment constraints (Gopalsamy, 2023; Singh & Dubey, 2024). All of these are
challenges that are considered to be bottleneck in the use of AI-driven malware detection and
classification systems. Thus, there is a need to ensure that all of these are given consideration
towards the achievement of AI-enhanced systems for malware detection and classification.

**CONCLUSION**

The study concludes that AI-driven malware detection and classification spans across different
fields. It was established that there are different techniques used in AI-driven malware detection
and classification. These techniques can help increase predictive capabilities in malware detection
systems, which can be used for malware detection and classification. Despite the several
challenges associated with the use of AI-driven malware detection and classification, the study
recognized that AI-driven malware detection and classification are highly effective compared to
traditional methods or the methods that are available at the moment. This emphasizes the relevance
and usefulness of AI-enhanced systems for malware detection and classification. The study
established that there are different evaluation strategies of AI-driven malware detection and
classification, which include standard metrics, benchmarked datasets, experimental comparisons,
and cross-validation. The study established that the challenges associated with the use of AI-driven

malware detection and classification systems include dataset limitations, computational
complexity, adversarial attacks, interpretability, and real-time deployment constraints.
**Implications**

The study provides policy and practical implications. Government and regulatory bodies should
incorporate AI-driven malware detection and classification within their different countries’
cybersecurity frameworks. They should come up with policies and mandate the integration of AIdriven solutions in sectors such as national security, health, and finance. Also, governments should
prioritize the funding of research that seeks to provide more evidence on AI-driven cybersecurity
solutions to address challenges such as interpretability, dataset limitations, and adversarial attacks.
Moreover, there is a need for policymakers in different countries to design policies that will
encourage secured and ethical data sharing among cybersecurity experts to overcome the challenge
of dataset limitations. This will improve the robustness of the available datasets and enhance AIdriven malware detection and classification.

The study will be of benefit to cybersecurity experts and practitioners as it will provide them with
evidence on how they can enhance cyber defense with the integration of AI-driven tools into their
security operations to improve malware detection and classification. The study will be relevant to
experts to help them optimize the available security resources using predictive AI tools to improve
operational efficiency. Moreover, organizations and developments should consider the application
of standardized evaluation strategies to validate and improve their AI models before or after
deployment in malware detection and classification. Furthermore, developers should address
challenges like computational complexity and real-time constraint if they want to have AI-driven
systems that are practical for real-world use. Moreover, there is a need for cybersecurity experts
to be resilient against advanced threats by ensuring that their model robustness is improved to
forestall adversarial attacks.

**Recommendations**

The following recommendations are proffered based on the study’s findings:

1. There is a need for continuous update of datasets to reflect new attack vectors.
2. Organizations and cybersecurity experts should adopt AI-enhanced malware detection
and classification systems to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.
3. There is a need for more awareness on the need for a pool or cloud for datasets to
enhance datasets sharing, which can address the challenge of dataset limitations.
4. It is recommended that developers should consider the use of explainable AI (XAI) to
improve interpretability of AI-based malware detection and classification systems.
5. There is a need for cybersecurity expert to incorporate adversarial defense mechanisms.
